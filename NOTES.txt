I forgot to add the updated code before I left for the holidays, so I made this.
- Unknown items and item identification? Could work if descriptions & identification status are stored in the item id list. Shop items are always identified, and buying them will identify those items when encountered later on.
- Add in Scint, a silvery powder found in places between places. It is used as currency, but is rather bulky and often exchanged for bank notes.
- There are foci that can be used as temporary spells, so long as the player has a weapon with a focal notch in it.
- Experience is gained by killing things, as well as possibly some other things, like lockpicking. When you gain enough experience, you gain a Revelation, which can either be stored for later or used to improve one of several skill trees, including those of your allies. Revelations can be sold at specific places, and rarely bought for a high fee, and some things require revelations to function.
- Lock behind some of the more powerful skill trees behind bosses?
- Had an idea: The reason for the MC's quasi-revival and ability to use ephemera is due to the weapon they have.
- To complement this, relics will take the role of adjusting stats rather than weapons & armor.
- Gaining specific ephemera powers (namely those not accessable via skill trees) requires Lore. These can be bought, gained via story events or allies, or found in tomes. When the player gains Lore, they get a selection of four abilities to put it into rather than it going to a random ability. This luxury is not always avaliable.
- Tinctures/potions also exist. Steal from my other projects. Exact use varies between substance, and is present in the description when identified.
- Add in coffers, reliquaries, lockboxes, and tomes. These need to be unlocked, which can be done via several means.
 - The most notable way to do this is to take them to a locksmith NPC in a town or a dungeon shop. They do this for a fee, but it always works.
 - Lockpicks have a chance to fail and a chance to break, but can be used in the field. These items are very rare as loot but common at shops. Can also be used to open locked doors.
 - Skeleton keys are extremely rare and single-use, but always succeed.
 - Some ephemera powers can unlock things as well.
 - Coffers can contain a variety of items, mostly consumables, such as chained ephemera, tinctures/potions, foci, & reagents. They also have a high chance to contain scint. If openned by a locksmith and scint is dropped, it is garunteed to give slightly more than the cost of opening the coffer.
 - Reliquaries give relics, reagents, and rarely, a revelation.
 - Lockboxes contain weapons, relics, and various consumables. They usually give more than coffers and reliquaries, but are harder to open.
 - Tomes give experience, and rarely a revelation as well. They may also give Lore fragments on specific ephemera powers, sometimes more than one.
 
- ENTITY NOTES -
- Enemies spawn both on level generation and randomly after every 50 actions or so. How to have line of sight work? Check for an aggressive status if there are no obstructions in the way?
- Most enemies have an experience flat & roll, a loot chance, a loot-table, an ephemera chance, and an ephemera type. If they die, they grant the experience flat as well as a number between 0 and the roll. They have a chance to drop loot (though some enemies lack a loot table), and if that fails, they have a chance to drop an ephemera of their given type.

- EPHEMERA NOTES - 
This is the system that will hopefully seperate the game from others, gameplay-wise.
- Ephemera are gained from slain enemies. They degrade over time and as they are used. They can be used when equipt, with the player starting with 2 slots; they cannot be removed intact.
- Chained ephemera exist, gained from dungeons or shops. They are decently rare and very expensive, but only start degrading when equipt.
- Some items have ephemera essence bound to them. At specific shops or through a few powers, one can extract these ephemera, usually at the cost of the item. Such items can either be specially tagged mundane items or pre-determined relics that always have the same ephemera.
- Ephemera can be stored at two locations, where they do not degrade. They are very hard to reach.
- Ephemera fuel various abilities:
 - Channelling: As the player improves (whether through experience or some other system) they learn Channelling Spells. Most of these require ephemera of a specific type to use, and have effects that are usually only modified by their ability trees.
 - Infusion: Placing ephemera into items with the occasional help of a practitioner and/or some catalysts. You will need a few ephemera at least to improve an item, but the results are usually good. Unlike other forms, infusion does not require ephemera to be equipt to use, only that the player has them.
 - Infusion aspect names: Niveu(White), Luteu(Orange), Signu(Magenta), Liveu(Lblue), Croceu(Yellow), Tiliu(Lime), Roseu(Pink), (Gray), (Lgray), (Cyan), (Purple), Caeru(Blue), (Brown), (Green), (Brown), (Red), (Black)
 - Encantation: Learned powers that require reagents to use. Usually quite powerful, but costly.
 - Words of Power: A handful of powerful spells that require 8 ephemera to function, 4 of which must be of a specific type. Using a Word destroys all ephemera, and its power is determined by the number of expended ephemera.
- Possible Ephemera Powers
 - On-the-fly infusion/chained ephemera creation/other stuff.
 - Elemental strike in a pattern (cone, straight line, circle, square, etc.) (May also only hurt enemies or be effected by terrain.)
 - Temporarily buff the stats of you and/or your allies.
 - Turn not-regular fire into regular fire and vice versa.

4 - Reduced skint loss on death
5 - Increase bag size to 32
6 - Increase bag size to 64
7 - 
8 - 

- ALCHEMY & TINCTURES NOTES -
- If the player doesnt want to search for or buy a tincture, they can make one by mixing various reagents together.
- Tincture recipies are random per save, but usually have some consistencies (potions usually have the same base and the same catalysts, or later on, the same amount of required aspects.)
- Reagents and base fluids are used in alchemy. Base fluids can be found in bottles (of which are obtained from spent potions or as loot.) Some world objects, such as fluid tiles, can be tapped for base fluids with an empty bottle.
- Field alchemy is avaliable from the start, having the player mix a reagent (or sometimes other objects) into a base fluid or existing tincture. The results are not always potions, and are generally unpredictable, though some npcs may give hints.
 - There might be a Book of Lore tab that, when unlocked, shows all known reactions in field alchemy, among other things. Pages for this can be purchased from shops sometimes, either being random 'unlabeled' notes or 'detailing' a specific undiscovered combination ('unlabeled alchemy notes' and 'alchemy notes detailing <Liquid> and <Ingredient>' respectively.)
- Aspect alchemy is another method done either at an alembic or with the aid of an alchemist npc. The former are rare structures (or a portable item, though this is rare) that can be used to distill up to eight reagents and a base fluid into a tincture.
 - Like field alchemy, these recipies are randomized per save file, but hold no risk short of wasting the ingredients.
 - Also like field alchemy, recipies can be found in shops or at random, seperated into 'unlabeled' notes and specific recipies ('Unlabeled Alchemical Formula' and '<Tincture> Formula' respectively.>
 - Alchemist NPCs cost scint to use, but can supplement reagents for large quantities of scint. They can also sell tinctures directly, usually at the same price as replacing an entire tincture's recipe with scint.
-MIXING REACTIONS-
- These will be determined by applying a list of limited reactions (namely x into tincture), then by applying the same list of repeatable reactions until all reaction slots are set for the save.
 - There be a whole bunch of these for 'x into tincture' reactions.

- REVELATION UPGRADES NOTES -
NOTE: 'B-' requires both of the options that come after the directional option. The others require the one before them.
1-<White>
- 
 - 
  - Unleash <> : Consumes a White Ephemera to unleash a randomized wave of pale crystal. This is liable to hitting allies. Further levels improve damage and reduce damage vs. friendlies.
 - Valuable Understanding : Items hidden behind cover glow slightly. Increased levels make this more obvious, but its cheap after the initial purchace.
  - <> : Makes different items glow different colors(White for Scint, Red for Coffers, Blue for Relics, etc.)
  B- Object of Desire : A 4th-power relic spawns in the player's storage. This can be taken endlessly at an exponentially rising cost.
